      Which of my items have most children? Are there too many?
     
      Sitecore recommendation:
         Limit the number of versions of any item to the fewest possible. 
         Sitecore recommends keeping 10 or fewer versions on any item, but policy may dictate this to be a higher number. 
         There is a shared source module, Version Manager, available at: 
         http://marketplace.sitecore.net/en/Modules/Version_Manager.aspx to help manage versions.
     
      Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to your site e.g. "Sitecore/content/My Site"
     
      How to read this report?
      ------------------------
      The report will show you all the nodes that have more than 10 versions. 
      If the list is empty (no results shown) it means your solution is not violating the recommendation and you can give yourself a pat on the back.
