      Do my items restrict access rights?
     
      Sitecore recommendation:
         Break inheritance rather than explicitly deny access rights — 
           It is a recommended practice to break inheritance in cases where the access right should be denied 
           instead of explicitly denying it for a security account. If you deny an access right explicitly to a security account, 
           the only way to override this denial of access is to do it directly on a user account. 
           This creates an overhead in security management when you would like a user to inherit this role and some other role 
           that should allow the same right access.
     
      Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to where you store your solution templates e.g. "/sitecore/content/My Site"
     
      How to read this report?
      ------------------------
      The report will show you all items that restrict rights rather than break inheritance, potentially breaking this recommendation.
      It does not necessarily mean that the approach is wrong, but you should consider restructuring your security setting 
      according to the Sitecore best practice.
