      Do my tree/list/link selection fields narrow selection?
     
      Sitecore recommendation:
         Use the special syntax to restrict the results on Treelists, DropTrees, and TreelistEx 
         to make sure users can only select the appropriate items, or Sitecore query in the other selection fields.
     
      Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to where you store your solution templates e.g. "Sitecore/templates/My Site Templates"
     
      How to read this report?
      ------------------------
      The report will show you all template fields in your solution and whether or not they define the Source query.
      Just because a field does not define source, doesn't mean it's a problem, but this report allows you to have a view on all of them and decide whether you can improve your user experience.
