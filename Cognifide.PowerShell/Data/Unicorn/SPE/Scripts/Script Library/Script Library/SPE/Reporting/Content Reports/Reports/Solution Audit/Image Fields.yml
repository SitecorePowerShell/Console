      What "Image" type fields do I have and in which template? Do they have Source defined?
     
      Sitecore recommendation:
         Image Fields — Define the source field to show the point 
                        in the media library that is relevant to the item being created.
     
      Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to where you store your solution templates e.g. "Sitecore/templates/My Site Templates"
     
      How to read this report?
      ------------------------
      The report will show all fields of type "Image" and a path ot a template it's defined in.
      Just because field does not define Source, doesn't mean it's a problem, but this report allows you to have a view on all of them and decide.
