The Sitecore PowerShell Extensions module (SPE) provides a robust environment for automating tasks within Sitecore.

![Sitecore PowerShell Extensions](docs/readme-ise.gif)

## Prerequisites

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) — install via `winget install Task.Task`, `choco install go-task`, or `scoop install task`
- Docker Desktop for Windows
- Visual Studio 2022+ with the .NET desktop workload

## Quick Start

Run `task --list` to see all available commands.

### Local IIS development

If you have Sitecore installed locally (not Docker), use the `local:` tasks:

1. Copy `src/deploy.user.json.sample` to `src/deploy.user.json`
2. Edit it to point to your Sitecore webroot(s) and set `"junction": true`
3. Build and deploy:

```powershell
task local:deploy
```

This finds MSBuild via vswhere, restores NuGet packages, rebuilds the solution, and deploys to all sites in your `deploy.user.json`. With junctions enabled, JS/CSS/XML/config edits are live instantly - only C# changes need a redeploy.

To run Playwright UI tests against your local site, add a `test` block to your site in `deploy.user.json` (see sample file), then:

```powershell
task ui:test
```

See [src/DEPLOYMENT.md](src/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full configuration reference.

### Docker development

```
task init            # Set up local dev environment (license, certs, .env)
task up              # Start Docker environment
task down            # Stop Docker environment
task logs            # Tail CM container logs
task build           # Build the solution
task deploy          # Deploy build output to Docker container
task generate        # Generate .dat files from serialized content
task release         # Build release packages
task verify          # Validate packages against serialized items
task test            # Run integration tests
task clean           # Clean build artifacts
```

First-time setup:

```powershell
task init -- -LicenseXmlPath "C:\path\to\license.xml"
task up
task build
task deploy
```

## Troubleshooting: Docker

### Identity Server crashes with `NullReferenceException` on JWKS endpoint

**Symptom:** The Identity Server container logs show:

```
Duende.IdentityServer.Hosting.IdentityServerMiddleware [Fatal]
Unhandled exception: "Object reference not set to an instance of an object."
```

Requests to `https://speid.dev.local/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks` return `500 Internal Server Error`.

**Cause:** The `SITECORE_ID_CERTIFICATE` in `.env` contains an **ECC (Elliptic Curve)** certificate. Sitecore Identity Server (Duende IdentityServer) requires an **RSA** certificate for JWT token signing. When it tries to extract the RSA key from an ECC cert, it throws a `NullReferenceException`.

**Fix:** Regenerate the certificate and restart the containers:

```powershell
task init -- -LicenseXmlPath "C:\path\to\license.xml"
docker compose down
task up
```

The `cert.ps1` script generates `devcert.pfx` as an RSA certificate with legacy PFX encryption, which is compatible with both Traefik (TLS) and Identity Server (JWT signing).

### Identity Server container is not healthy

**Symptom:** `docker compose ps` shows the `id` container as unhealthy, and other services that depend on it fail to start or authenticate.

**Common causes:**
- **Database not ready** — the `mssql-init` container hasn't finished seeding the Core database. Wait and check `docker compose logs mssql-init`.
- **Certificate issues** — see the JWKS error above.
- **Missing `.env` values** — ensure `SITECORE_ID_CERTIFICATE`, `SITECORE_ID_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, and `SITECORE_IDSECRET` are set. Run `task init` to regenerate them.

## Examples

Consider some of the following examples to see how SPE can improve your quality of life as a Sitecore developer/administrator:

- Make changes to a large number of pages:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path master:\content\home -Recurse |
    ForEach-Object { $_.Text += "<p>Updated with SPE</p>"  }
```

- Find the oldest page on your site:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path master:\content\home -Recurse |
    Select-Object -Property Name,Id,"__Updated" |
    Sort-Object -Property "__Updated"
```

- Remove a file from the Data directory:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path $SitecoreDataFolder\packages -Filter "readme.txt" | Remove-Item
```

- Rename items in the Media Library:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "master:\media library\Images" |
    ForEach-Object { Rename-Item -Path $_.ItemPath -NewName ($_.Name + "-old") }
```

## Remoting Authentication

SPE remoting accepts three authentication modes. They coexist: the server looks at each incoming request's token shape and dispatches to the matching provider, so you can mix modes in the same deployment and migrate one consumer at a time.

| Mode | Where credentials live | When to pick it | Token shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| Config-level shared secret | A single secret in `Spe.config` (or a patch) | Simplest setup for trusted automation where one CI pipeline calls SPE | Client mints HS256 JWT from the shared secret |
| Shared Secret Client (per-item) | A `Shared Secret Client` item under `/sitecore/system/Modules/PowerShell/Settings/Access/Remoting Clients` | Multiple consumers that each need their own secret, policy, impersonated user, or throttling limits | HMAC JWT with a `kid` header pointing at the item's Access Key Id |
| OAuth Client (per-item) | An `OAuth Client` item mapped to a JWT `(iss, client_id)` pair | XM Cloud style integrations against an external IdP (Sitecore Identity Server, Auth0, Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak) | Externally-issued RS256 / RS384 / RS512 / ES256 JWT validated via JWKS |

The three modes run concurrently. Dispatch is driven by the JWT's `alg` header: HMAC algorithms route to the shared-secret provider (which then chooses config-level vs per-item by `kid`), and the RSA/EC algorithms route to the OAuth provider. Existing shared-secret deployments keep working unchanged when OAuth is activated.

### Remoting Client items

Per-item modes use Sitecore items under `/sitecore/system/Modules/PowerShell/Settings/Access/Remoting Clients` that derive from the abstract `Remoting Client` template. Common fields (Impersonated User, Policy, Enabled, Expires, Throttling) live on the base. The concrete subtypes add mode-specific fields:

- **Shared Secret Client** - `Access Key Id`, `Shared Secret`
- **OAuth Client** - `Allowed Issuer`, `OAuth Client Ids` (multi-line; one client_id per line)

Each item also picks a Remoting Policy (allowlist + language mode + audit level), which applies regardless of auth mode.

Save-time validators reject wildcard / reserved / shorter-than-8 `client_id` values and duplicate `(iss, client_id)` pairs across items. Saving an item invalidates the server-side cache so Enabled=false takes effect on the next request.

### How config and items layer

Both shared-secret modes (config-level and per-item) flow through the same `<authenticationProvider>` instance registered in `Spe.config`. Items contribute the credential and identity; config contributes the token-validation policy. A few consequences worth knowing before provisioning:

- **The config-level provider must be registered for any HS\* token to validate.** A Shared Secret Client item does not stand on its own: it supplies the secret, `kid`, Impersonated User, policy, throttle, and expiry. Every other validation knob (`<allowedIssuers>`, `<allowedAudiences>`, `<maxTokenLifetimeSeconds>`, `<clockSkewSeconds>`, `<detailedAuthenticationErrors>`) is read from the config-level provider. The default Spe.config already registers it, so this is usually invisible.
- **The `<sharedSecret>` element is not required for item auth.** It stays commented out in the default config and only powers the legacy no-`kid` path. Item-based clients never consult it.
- **No per-item override of validation policy.** Issuer / audience lists, token lifetime, and clock skew are one-size-fits-all across the deployment. The templates do not express, for example, a short-lived CI key alongside a long-lived automation key.
- **`iss` / `aud` are not a per-client security boundary for HMAC.** The caller mints its own token and writes whatever `iss` / `aud` it wants, so those lists cannot isolate one Shared Secret Client from another - the shared secret itself is what makes the token unforgeable. The lists still provide a useful cross-deployment sanity check (a token stamped for deployment A will not validate at deployment B if they use different values), which is why they are kept global.
- **Defaults typically work out of the box.** The shipped `<allowedIssuers>` contains `SPE Remoting` and `Web API`, `<allowedAudiences>` is empty (the request authority is auto-accepted), and the SPE PowerShell client mints with matching values. Operators adding Shared Secret Client items usually do not need to edit `Spe.config` at all; edits are only needed when tokens come from a non-default minter.

OAuth Clients follow the same split: per-item `Allowed Issuer` and `OAuth Client Ids` route the incoming token to a Sitecore identity, while the cryptographic / claim policy (`<jwksUri>`, `<allowedIssuers>`, `<allowedAudiences>`, `<requiredScopes>`) lives on the `<oauthBearer>` config entry.

### OAuth bearer setup

The provider ships as `App_Config/Include/Spe/Spe.OAuthBearer.config.example`. Copy it to `Spe.OAuthBearer.config` (drop the `.example` suffix) to activate. Unlike earlier drafts of this feature, activating OAuth does **not** replace the shared-secret provider - both providers register side by side under a plural `<authenticationProviders>` list.

Populate the four required fields before activating: `<jwksUri>`, `<allowedIssuers>`, `<allowedAudiences>`, `<requiredScopes>`. The provider validates `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, lifetime, `iss`, `aud`, scopes, and the cryptographic signature against keys fetched from the JWKS endpoint. The Impersonated User for the authenticated session comes from the matched OAuth Client item, not the config.

The client-side entry point is `New-ScriptSession -AccessToken <jwt>`. The session reuses the token across `Invoke-RemoteScript`, `Send-RemoteItem`, and `Receive-RemoteItem` calls.

### Local testing against Sitecore Identity Server

The Docker stack already runs Sitecore Identity Server at `https://speid.dev.local`. `docker-compose.override.yml` registers a `spe-remoting` client that issues RS256 JWTs signed by IDS. This is the same IdP shape that SCS CLI authenticates against on-prem.

One-time setup:

```
task init                                                                # seeds SPE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET in .env
task up && task deploy                                                   # or 'docker compose up -d id' if already up
# Activate the OAuth provider (inside the deploy output so the file watcher picks it up):
cp "docker/deploy/App_Config/Include/Spe/Spe.OAuthBearer.config.example" \
   "docker/deploy/App_Config/Include/Spe/Spe.OAuthBearer.config"
```

Fetch a token and open a remoting session (PowerShell 7+). Substitute the literal client secret below, or load `SPE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` from `.env` into the current shell first:

```powershell
$body = @{
    grant_type    = "client_credentials"
    client_id     = "spe-remoting"
    client_secret = $env:SPE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
    scope         = "spe.remoting"
}
$token = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://speid.dev.local/connect/token" -Method POST `
    -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -Body $body -SkipCertificateCheck).access_token

$session = New-ScriptSession -ConnectionUri https://spe.dev.local -AccessToken $token
Invoke-RemoteScript -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Get-User -Current }
```

Contributors working inside the SPE repo can skip the `Invoke-RestMethod` boilerplate and use `scripts/Get-SpeOAuthToken.ps1`, which reads `.env` and trusts the dev cert automatically.

The dev-stack defaults (`jwksUri`, `allowedIssuers`, `allowedAudiences`, `requiredScopes`) live in `z.Spe.Development.OAuth.config` and patch the provider automatically when it's activated. `jwksUri` uses container-internal DNS (`http://id/...`) so CM can reach IDS without the Traefik-fronted hostname. Two audiences are listed - `spe-remoting` and `https://speid.dev.local/resources` - because IDS includes both in the token's `aud` array.

Run the integration test phase with `Run-RemotingTests.ps1 -IncludeOAuth`.

### Inspecting tokens

The SPE Remoting module ships two diagnostic cmdlets that base64url-decode a JWT so you can confirm its claims match what your `<oauthBearer>` config expects. Neither cmdlet validates the signature - they exist solely to answer "does this token actually carry the `iss` / `aud` / `scope` I think it does?" when a 401 needs triaging.

Given a JWT string in `$token` (from any of the examples above or below):

```powershell
$token | ConvertFrom-JwtPayload           # iss, aud, exp, scope, azp, sub, ...
$token | ConvertFrom-JwtHeader            # alg, kid, typ
$token | ConvertFrom-JwtPayload -Raw      # decoded JSON string for piping
(ConvertFrom-JwtPayload -Token $token).aud   # pick a single claim
```

No token handy? Paste this synthetic JWT (all `example.com` values, `exp` is year 2286, opaque signature) to see the cmdlets work end-to-end without standing up an IdP:

```powershell
$sample = "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImRlbW8ta2V5In0." +
          "eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tLyIsImF1ZCI6WyJzcGUtcmVtb3RpbmciLCJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlcyJdLCJzY29wZSI6InNwZS5yZW1vdGluZyIsImV4cCI6OTk5OTk5OTk5OX0." +
          "ZGVtby1zaWduYXR1cmUtbm90LXZlcmlmaWVk"

$sample | ConvertFrom-JwtHeader    # alg=RS256, typ=JWT, kid=demo-key
$sample | ConvertFrom-JwtPayload   # iss, aud (array), scope, exp
```

The array `aud` deliberately mirrors the IDS / Auth0 shape so the example also illustrates how that claim comes back.

### Other identity providers

Pointing the provider at an external IdP is a config-only change: update `<jwksUri>`, `<allowedIssuers>`, and `<allowedAudiences>` and restart the app domain. The validation pipeline does not depend on which IdP issued the token.

- **Auth0 dev tenant** is the closest match for the `auth.sitecorecloud.io` identity flow used by Sitecore XM Cloud, since the Cloud Portal itself is Auth0-backed. Create an API with identifier `spe-remoting` (becomes `aud`), define a scope `spe.remoting`, and authorize a Machine-to-Machine application.
- **Microsoft Entra ID** works for enterprise-federated scenarios. Note that the `iss` claim format differs between v1.0 and v2.0 endpoints (`sts.windows.net/{tenant}/` vs `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0`); add both to `<allowedIssuers>` if you support both endpoints.
- **Keycloak / Okta / any OIDC provider** works as long as it exposes a JWKS endpoint and signs with RS256 / RS384 / RS512 / ES256.

### Fetching a client-credentials token

The token-fetch call varies per IdP. Once you have a token, pass it verbatim to `New-ScriptSession -AccessToken`. The snippets below cover the three request shapes SPE is most likely to encounter. Each is illustrative - check your IdP's current docs before adapting to production.

**Sitecore Identity Server** (and most IdentityServer-based deployments):

```powershell
$body = @{
    grant_type    = "client_credentials"
    client_id     = "spe-remoting"
    client_secret = $env:SPE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
    scope         = "spe.remoting"
}
$resp = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://speid.dev.local/connect/token" -Method POST `
    -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -Body $body
$token = $resp.access_token
```

**Auth0** (closest analogue to the Cloud Portal / auth.sitecorecloud.io flow):

```powershell
$resp = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://<tenant>.us.auth0.com/oauth/token" -Method POST `
    -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{
        grant_type    = "client_credentials"
        client_id     = "<m2m-app-client-id>"
        client_secret = "<m2m-app-client-secret>"
        audience      = "https://spe-remoting"
        scope         = "spe.remoting"
    } | ConvertTo-Json)
$token = $resp.access_token
```

**Microsoft Entra ID** (v2.0 endpoint):

```powershell
$tenant = "<tenant-id>"
$appIdUri = "api://<spe-api-app-id>"
$body = @{
    grant_type    = "client_credentials"
    client_id     = "<m2m-app-client-id>"
    client_secret = "<m2m-app-client-secret>"
    scope         = "$appIdUri/.default"
}
$resp = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenant/oauth2/v2.0/token" `
    -Method POST -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -Body $body
$token = $resp.access_token
```

Shape differences worth flagging:

- **Body format.** Auth0 accepts JSON; IdentityServer and Entra require form-urlencoded per RFC 6749.
- **Audience carriage.** Auth0 uses a dedicated `audience` parameter; Entra folds the audience into `scope` as `<app-id-uri>/.default`; IdentityServer derives it from the API resource the scope belongs to.
- **Issuer format.** Auth0 issuers always end with a trailing slash (`https://<tenant>.us.auth0.com/`). Entra v1 and v2 issuers differ by endpoint - add every shape you accept to `<allowedIssuers>`.

After fetching, `$token | ConvertFrom-JwtPayload` is the fastest way to confirm the token carries the `iss` / `aud` / `scope` your `<oauthBearer>` config is configured to accept.
